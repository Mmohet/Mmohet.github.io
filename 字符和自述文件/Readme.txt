Hello everyone, this is Mohet
I also paid for Jotaro-SPR for about a year, but I finally made something like this...
The VAR switches is in -2.cns, you can adjust it yourself...(I know there most of people hate it so I use VAR to close it)
Characters are all free, if you buy it, it means you have been cheated
The characters will be updated continuously, you can look at: https://mmohet.github.io/
Here is my Github URL, and the same will continue to be updated
As for character's strength, use the 7-12p test(same...I hope you  will never use it)
All VAR switches will be on by default at 7-12p, and ai will use OVER HEAVEN by default

It is not troublesome for characters to make moves, only x(u), next x, y(i), z(o), and s(p) are special moves, and the others are no different from normal jus characters
(I won't list the strengths here because I don't know the English of the various technologies) ðŸ˜‚
(Please make a copy of this document and pack it together outside the SPR character pack, thank you)
